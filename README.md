# Taken_Mind_Internship
A repository for all the weekly assignments done during the Training period of my Global Internship in Taken_Mind along with the Final Project and their documentation.

The tasks given to me were aimed to understand data trying to control attrition. There are two sets of data: “Existing employees” and “Employees who have left”.  Following attributes are available for every employee:
1. Satisfaction Level
2. Last evaluation
3. Number of projects
4. Average monthly hours
5. Time spent at the company
6. Whether they have had a work accident
7. Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
8. Departments (column sales)
9. Salary
10. Whether the employee has left

**Objectives**
- What type of employees are leaving?
- Predict/Determine which employees are prone to leave next.
- Recommendations

**Additional**
During this time I was also communicating with team of interns from 13 different nationalities globally which developed my communication and leadership skills.
I used Statistics and Econometrics along with Data Analytics and Data Visualization. 
All the codes and repositories such as violin plots, bar plots, heat maps, etc were created from scratch and documented from end to end.
